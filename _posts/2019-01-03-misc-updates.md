Originally my thoughts were not to use the Blog section of this website; however, I've decided that a small update every now and then wouldn't be too bad for those that may be interested.

- **Updates** I've made a number of changes and added some new recipes since initially implementing this site around Christmas 2018.
- **Reasong for using** as mentioned on the home page, I've found this format to be a good "central" location to store recipes in a "generic" format if the decision is made to move to something else in the future.
