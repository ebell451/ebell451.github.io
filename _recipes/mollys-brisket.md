title: "Molly's Brisket"
tags: main

ingredients:
- 1 whole Beef Brisket, well trimmed of fat
- Salt and Pepper
- Celery Seed
- Worcestershire Powder, optional
- Garlic Powder
- Onion Powder
- Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 box Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix (2 envelopes)
- 1 large Onion, thinly sliced
- 8 oz Sliced Button Mushrooms (optional)
- Your Favorite Barbecue Sauce

directions:
- To prepare the brisket:
- Preheat oven to 300°.
- Use heavy duty foil; tear two LONG pieces and place them in a cross on a baking sheet with 1 inch sides.
- Place brisket in the center and season the leanest side generously with salt, pepper, celery seed, Worcestershire powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and several dashes of Worcestershire sauce.
- Turn brisket over, and repeat on the other side with the same seasonings. Remember, season generously!
- The side with the most fat should be up during cooking.
- Next, sprinkle the top with the two envelopes of the onion soup mix.
- Top with sliced onion and mushrooms if you are using them.
- Drizzle top with barbecue sauce (maybe ½ -3/4 Cup).
- Wrap tightly in the foil. You want to be sure no juices escape.
- Bake in the slow oven 5 hours.
- At the end of the 5 hours, open foil up to expose the top of the brisket. Careful! It’s very hot, and steam rushes out as you open the top of the package.
- Add more barbecue sauce (about the same amount as before) and return to the oven – brisket uncovered, for another hour.
- The cooking time is always the same, regardless of the size of the brisket.
- Remove the brisket from the oven, and carefully transfer it to a cutting board.
- Tent it with foil to keep it warm and let it rest about 15 minutes for juices to redistribute before slicing.
- Slice in thin slices across the grain. I find an electric knife is the best for this job!
- To prepare the sauce: Pour drippings collected in the foil into a fat separator. Transfer just the defatted drippings to a saucepan, add more BBQ Sauce, and thicken as desired with a bit of cornstarch dissolved in cold water.
- Make Ahead Tip: The brisket can be made and sliced the day before. Reheat, covered tightly, at 350° for 20-30 minutes or until hot throughout. It can also be cooked and frozen.
