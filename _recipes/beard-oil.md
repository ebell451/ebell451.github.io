image: placeholder.png
tags: beard, oil, non-food

ingredients:
Carrier Oil Base (The Foundation)
- 1.5 oz Jojoba Oil - Mimics natural skin oils to nourish follicles
- 1.0 oz Argan Oil - Softens wiry gray hair and provides deep hydration
- 1.0 oz Sweet Almond Oil - Rich in Vitamin D to support hair strength
- 0.5 oz Castor Oil - A dense oil to increase visual thickness and reduce breakage
Active Additives (Essential Oils)
- 15 drops Sandalwood - Stimulates keratin receptors and provides a premium scent
- 15 drops Cedarwood - Strengthens the hair shaft and provides a woodsy base
- 15 drops Rosemary - Increase blood circulation to thinning areas
- 10 drops Peppermint - Stimulates the follicles for growth (provides a fresh tingle)
- 10 drops Vitamin E Oil - A natural preservative that protects hair from environmental damage


directions:
- Apply oil once daily after a warm shower
- The Skin First - Use 5-10 drops (adjust for length). Rub into palms and massage fingertips into the skin beneath the beard first to stimulate the roots
- The Pull-Through - Once the skin is covered, pull your hands down the length of the beard
- The Finish -  Use a [Boar Bristle Brush](https://amzn.to/4j63Rc3) or a wide-tooth comb. This is essential for long beards to distribute the heavy Castor oil from the skin to the tips of the gray hair, sealing the cuticles and preventing thinning from breakage.
