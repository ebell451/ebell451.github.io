tags: dessert, cookies

ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 3/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (do not exceed 72% cacao), coarsely chopped
- Maldon or other flaky sea salt

directions:
- Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375Â°.
- Whisk flour, baking powder, kosher salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl; set aside.
- Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar, sugar, and powdered sugar until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes.
- Add egg yolks, egg, and vanilla.
- Beat, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until mixture is pale and fluffy, 4-5 minutes.
- Reduce mixer speed to low; slowly add dry ingredients, mixing just to blend.
- Using a spatula, fold in chocolate.
- Spoon rounded tablespoonfuls of cookie dough onto 2 parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing 1-inch apart.
- Sprinkle cookies with sea salt.
- Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until just golden brown around the edges, 10-12 minutes. The cookies will firm up as they cool.
- Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks; let cool completely.
- DO AHEAD - Cookies can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
