title: "Hamburger Buns"
tags: buns, hamburger, bread maker

ingredients:
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon sugar (I use Sugar in the Raw)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 envelope active dry yeast

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°
- Combine the milk and water and heat in microwave safe dish for 60 seconds (or until warm).
- Add everything to your bread maker (liquids first). Set your bread maker to dough.
- When the maker finishes its dough cycle, punch down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger than a golf ball. Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly around and pinching it at the bottom. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. You may want to oil your palm first. Set rolls aside and cover them until they double in size, about 20 minutes. 
- Bake for 14 minutes in a 400°oven or until nicely browned on the top and bottom. When they cool a bit, cut in half with a bread knife. They freeze beautifully.
- Enjoy!
