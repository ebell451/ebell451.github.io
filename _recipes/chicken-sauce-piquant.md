CHICKEN SAUCE PIQUANTE

- 4-5 lbs of Thighs, Legs & Wings
- Garlic Salt & Pepper (to season chicken)
- 1 Yellow Onion
- 1 Green Bell Pepper
- 2 Sticks of Celery
- 4 Cloves of Garlic
- 1 Stick of Butter
- 2/3 Cup Vegetable Oil
- 1 Cup All Purpose Flour
- 1 (6 oz) Can of Tomato Paste
- 1 (14.5 oz) Can Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes
- 1 (10 oz) Can of Rotel (Mild for Less Spice)
- 1 (32oz) Container Chicken Stock
- 2 (15 oz) Cans of Tomato Sauce
- 2 Cups of Water
- 2 Tablespoons of Sugar
- 1 Tablespoon of Parsley Flakes
- 1 Tablespoon of Cajun or Creole Seasoning
- Rice to serve with


directions:
- Start out by heating a large pot over Medium/Low heat and a large pan over Medium heat.
- Chop the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Set aside in the fridge.
- If you have fresh parsley, chop that and set aside as well.
- Prep the chicken by seasoning with generous portions of garlic salt and black pepper.
- Next dust the chicken with a coat of flour. Shake off excess flour.
- In your large pan, add the stick of butter.
- Once the butter is completely melted, drop in the chicken one at a time.
- Sear the chicken 6-8 minutes on each side.
- Remove the chicken as you see both sides brown up nicely.
- While the chicken is searing, you want to get started on the roux.
- To your large pot, add the 2/3 cup of oil, and 1 cup all purpose flour.
- Begin stirring immediately. Consistently stir off and on until you reach a brown caramel-like color.
- During this process, make sure you keep an eye on the chicken.
- Try to mange time between pot and pan evenly, to prevent anything from burning.
- When all pieces of chicken have browned up evenly, move the chicken to a bowl, and add the chopped vegetables into the large pan.
- Stir the vegetables around the pan so that you get up any remaining drippings that were leftover from the chicken.
- Meanwhile, continue to take time to stir the roux.
- After about 10 minuets of sautéing the vegetables, add the tomato paste.
- Sauté for another 10 minuets.
- Next add the Rotel and cook for another 5 minutes.
- Add the fire roasted diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes.
- If the roux still hasn’t reached a caramel color, cover the pan of vegetables, lower to a simmering heat, and just come back to it every so often as you continue to cook the roux.
- Once the roux reaches a caramel color, slowly add in a small amount of the chicken stock. Stir until you reach a creamy mixture.
- Add the rest of the chicken stock to the tomato mixture.
- Pour the tomato mixture in with the roux, and blend evenly.
- Add the tomato sauce, two cups of water, sugar, cajun seasoning, and chopped parsley to the pot. Mix well
- Add the chicken to the pot, and push each piece down into the sauce. Pour in any remaining juices from the bowl the chicken was in.
- Raise the heat so that you bring the pot to a slight boil, cover, and let simmer for 2 hours.
- Come back and stir the bottom every 15 minutes.
- Cook some rice, and enjoy!
