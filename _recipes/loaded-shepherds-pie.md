title: "Loaded Shepherd's Pie"
tags: main

ingredients:
- 1 lb lean ground beef
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 1/4 cup onion, sliced
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 pkg (0.87 oz) brown gravy mix
- Loaded Potato Topping:
- 2 lbs potatoes, pared and diced
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 5 green onions, chopped
- 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 4 strips crisp-cooked bacon, diced
- water for potatoes
- salt

directions:
- Brown ground beef, onions and mushrooms over medium heat in a large skillet. Drain fat and season with salt, garlic powder and brown gravy mix. (I use brown gravy mix as a seasoning in this, and the juices will make some gravy. If you want more gravy, add about 1/2 cup of water-I have not tested this!). Stir well and set aside.
- Place diced potatoes in an appropriate size saucepan–2 quart size should be fine. Cover with water and add about 1-2 tsp salt.
- Boil potatoes until tender. Drain very well.
- Mash potatoes with sour cream, until potatoes are not lumpy. Add green onion and bacon–you can reserve a small amount for a garnish, if desired. Stir in cheese–you can reserve about 2 tbs of this for garnish if desired.
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
- Place reserved ground beef mixture in a 9-inch deep dish pie pan. Distribute evenly across the bottom.
- Top with mashed potatoes, covering meat entirely.
- Bake at 350 degrees F for about 30 minutes or until potatoes begin to get brown around the edges and peaks.
- Remove from oven and garnish with reserved onion, bacon & cheese if you desired to do so.
